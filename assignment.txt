In the folder /data there is a data set consisting of two files: municipality-listing-2020-10-21.parquet and most-popular-first-names-by-municipality.jsonl.gz

We wish you to:
---------------

1. Define relational database tables to hold the data set for reporting purposes.
2. Create an ETL / ELT solution for moving the data into the tables you have defined.

You may use any method to come up with the solution, but it would be nice to have it documented (as code for example), so that what you've done can be traced.
See the bottom of this file for more info about the data set.


As a bonus task you could either:
---------------------------------

a) Write unit tests for your ETL / ELT solution or
b) Use the data to answer the following question:
What is the relative frequency distribution over time (as percentages) for the most popular male names in the cities ('Kaupunki') of the region 'Pohjois-Savo'?
You may choose the means to solve the problem and present the outcome as you like, e.g. as a table, a figure or an sql query.


Additional information on the data set:
